      "message": "I think \"creating\" result objects is considered internal; but the result object itself is passed around to many public facing methods, e.g. results.AddValue is also used all over: https://cs.chromium.org/search/?q\u003dresults%5C.AddValue\n\nBut this is something soon we\u0027ll have to think about, as we try to move away from these legacy values in the context of the new results_processor. In a week or two I\u0027ll probably write a design doc about this very topic.",
