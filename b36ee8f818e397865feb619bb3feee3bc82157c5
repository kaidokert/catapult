I prefer if the underlying system is case insensitive that we use lowercase so that people don\u0027t have to remember casing rules (and so that they don\u0027t think they have to remember those rules.)\n\n3. If we can\u0027t think of a reason to change something, then it\u0027s better to keep it the same to reduce the mental load on sheriffs. Maybe you have some vague reason why you changed to dashes? If so, please explain and maybe it\u0027s worth changing them to dashes. Otherwise let\u0027s stay with underscores.",

The tags generated would be sanitized to replace underscores and spaces  with dashes. When I started making changes for telemetry benchmarks, I created a central  sanitation method in telemetry which is used to sanitize all tags generated by telemetry in the same way. That method replaces underscores and spaces with dashes. I started using that method to sanitize tags generated for GPU tests as well as telemetry benchmarks. I think we should leave the dashes in the tags because some of the methods used togenerate tags for GPU tests are being used to generate tags for telemetry benchmarks.",

I much rather keep Android-Webview and Android-Nexus-5X as separate tags instead of combining them. Luckily there are only 2 classes of tags. One class for tags that describe webview and non webview configurations. And another class for device type. You would only have at most two tags in an expectation tag list. I would update the documentation to explain that you  could use an android device type tag, android-webview or android-not-webview tag, or combination of android-webview and android device tag to write an expectation condition list for an android platform. \n\n2, \"buglink [ Android-Nexus-5X ] blah/* [ Skip ]\" would disable blah on all nexus 5x configurations which would include the webview configurations as  well as the non-webview configurations.",
