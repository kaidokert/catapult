A client is expected to make CreateInvocation RPC, and finalization is done by making UpdateInvocation RPC. The server will decide the finalization time.\n\nif this isn\u0027t LUCI invocation, then consider using a different term, otherwise it may get confusing later",

We only really need these to communicate info about the benchmark run from Telemetry to the new results processor code.\n\nI renamed things to reduce the chances of confusion, and adapted it more to our actual needs. Thanks for the pointers!\n\nI guess I won\u0027t really need a review from you. But feel free to share any comments/thoughts. :)",
